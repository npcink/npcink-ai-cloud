# Site Knowledge Runtime Contract v1

Status: MVP.

Cloud-managed Site Knowledge is a hosted runtime detail service. It indexes
bounded public WordPress content that the local WordPress side sends through the
Cloud Addon runtime client. It does not register WordPress abilities, own a
workflow registry, or write WordPress content.

## Runtime Abilities

The Cloud runtime accepts these static managed ability names:

- `npcink-cloud/site-knowledge-search`
- `npcink-cloud/site-knowledge-status`
- `npcink-cloud/site-knowledge-sync`

The matching contract versions are:

- `site_knowledge_search.v1`
- `site_knowledge_status.v1`
- `site_knowledge_sync.v1`

When Toolbox omits generic runtime routing fields, Cloud normalizes these
managed requests to:

- `profile_id`: `site-knowledge.managed`
- `execution_kind`: `knowledge`
- `ability_family`: `knowledge`
- `data_classification`: `public_site_content`

This normalization is a static runtime ingress compatibility path, not a Cloud
ability registry.

## Boundaries

- Results are always `suggestion_only`.
- Responses always include `direct_wordpress_write: false`.
- Site Knowledge is a writing-assistance evidence service. It helps writers
  find context, citations, gaps, duplicates, internal links, FAQ candidates,
  and refresh candidates; it must not produce ready-to-publish article content.
- Cloud may chunk, embed, store, search, rerank, and report status for public
  site knowledge.
- Public `post` and `page` sources may be indexed by default. Public approved
  comments may be indexed only when Cloud explicitly enables comment indexing.
- Cloud must not publish, update, delete, or otherwise mutate WordPress content.
- Cloud must not return article bodies, article titles, SEO copy,
  `article_write_plan` candidates, full article drafts, ready-to-publish
  content, or automatic publishing instructions from Site Knowledge.
- Cloud must not return provider keys, Cloud secrets, WordPress credentials,
  request headers, or full sensitive request payloads.
- Long `site-knowledge-sync` runs use the existing runtime worker path and
  `run_records`; no second queue, scheduler, or workflow engine is introduced.

## Metering Boundary

`npcink-cloud/site-knowledge-sync` is server-classified index maintenance. It
must remain entitlement-, capacity-, concurrency-, and provider-cost-governed,
but it does not consume the customer's ordinary `ai_credits` allowance.

Cloud still records its run, embedding provider calls, tokens, provider cost,
indexed `vector_documents`, and indexed `vector_chunks` as usage evidence. All
of those events carry `metering_class=site_knowledge_index_maintenance`; they
must not create consume entries in `credit_ledger_entries`. The classification
comes only from the canonical managed ability name. Request payload fields
cannot select or override it.

`site-knowledge-search`, writing-context retrieval, writing-package generation,
article generation, and other user-initiated inference continue through their
ordinary AI-credit policy. Index maintenance therefore cannot become an
unmetered provider-cost bypass, and an exhausted AI-credit balance cannot block
the maintenance needed to keep an already-entitled Site Knowledge index fresh.

## Vector Backend

Site Knowledge now uses one Cloud-owned vector profile as its configuration
truth:

```text
profile_id: site-knowledge.zh.v1
provider: SiliconFlow
model: BAAI/bge-m3
dimensions: 1024
metric: COSINE
production_backend: Zilliz Cloud
local_test_backend: PostgreSQL JSON
```

The profile facts are server-defined and read-only in Admin. The Admin input is
limited to the SiliconFlow API key plus the Zilliz cluster HTTPS endpoint and
token. Saving the embedding key performs a live embedding probe before
activation. The probe must return a non-empty array containing exactly 1024
finite numeric values. A missing, empty, non-numeric, non-finite,
768-dimensional, or 1536-dimensional result fails closed and does not replace
the currently verified connection.

The local/test backend stores one Cloud-owned read model in PostgreSQL:

- `site_knowledge_documents`
- `site_knowledge_chunks`

Rows are isolated by `site_id`. Embeddings are stored as JSON for the MVP and
scored in Python with cosine similarity. This keeps the first version within
the existing FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, and worker stack.

Production is fixed to Zilliz Cloud. Cloud Admin accepts only the cluster HTTPS
endpoint and token. The collection is fixed to `site_knowledge_zh_v1`, its
dimension is fixed to `1024`, its metric is fixed to `COSINE`, and no database
selector is exposed. The WordPress side only sends bounded `publish` public
content and executes the managed Cloud abilities.

Saving the Zilliz endpoint and token constructs the production backend before
persisting the new secret. A missing fixed collection is created with the
canonical schema and index. An existing collection is validated for required
fields, 1024 dimensions, and COSINE metric. An incompatible collection fails
closed and is not modified. A failed connection or schema probe does not
replace the currently verified vector-store connection.

`GET /internal/service/admin/site-knowledge-vector-profile` returns the fixed
profile, masked provider readiness, active backend, and Admin-owned vector-store
readiness. `PUT /internal/service/admin/site-knowledge-vector-profile`
accepts only an optional `credential` field and performs save-and-verify. It
does not accept caller-supplied provider, model, dimensions, metric, backend,
collection, reranker, or embedding-space fields.

`PUT /internal/service/admin/site-knowledge-vector-profile/vector-store`
accepts only optional `endpoint` and `token` fields so an already saved token
can be reverified. It does not accept collection, database, dimensions, metric,
backend, or migration fields. Both secrets remain encrypted and are represented
only as configured/readiness state in responses and audit evidence.

The verified profile connection is stored as a DB-managed Provider Connection
so the existing provider adapter, encrypted secret storage, runtime projection,
and audit evidence continue to be reused. Generic Provider Connection writes
cannot create or preserve the profile probe marker. Ability-model binding is
read-only for Site Knowledge and cannot override this profile.

The following remain environment-controlled runtime guardrails, because they
bound workload shape rather than identify a provider secret:

- `NPCINK_CLOUD_SITE_KNOWLEDGE_COMMENTS_ENABLED`: default `false`; when true,
  Cloud may index approved public comments supplied by WordPress.
- `NPCINK_CLOUD_SITE_KNOWLEDGE_MAX_SYNC_DOCUMENTS_PER_RUN`: default `500`.
  Limits how many public documents or comments one sync run may index.
- `NPCINK_CLOUD_SITE_KNOWLEDGE_MAX_SYNC_CHUNKS_PER_RUN`: default `5000`.
  Limits how many chunks one sync run may embed and write.
- `NPCINK_CLOUD_SITE_KNOWLEDGE_MAX_INDEXED_DOCUMENTS_PER_SITE`: default
  `10000`. Protects per-site storage and provider cost for very large sites.
- `NPCINK_CLOUD_SITE_KNOWLEDGE_MAX_INDEXED_CHUNKS_PER_SITE`: default
  `200000`. This is the main vector storage guardrail.
- `NPCINK_CLOUD_SITE_KNOWLEDGE_QUOTA_WARNING_RATIO`: default `0.85`.
  Status returns `near_limit` once document or chunk utilization reaches this
  ratio.
- `NPCINK_CLOUD_SITE_KNOWLEDGE_RERANK_TOP_K`: default `30`
- `NPCINK_CLOUD_SITE_KNOWLEDGE_RERANK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`: default `8`
- `NPCINK_CLOUD_SITE_KNOWLEDGE_ZILLIZ_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`: default `10`

The runtime may project the verified DB profile connection onto legacy
in-process settings fields while the Site Knowledge adapters are being
simplified. That bridge is an implementation detail, not a second model choice
or supported env credential surface.

The Zilliz adapter is intentionally behind a small backend interface. A later
DashVector migration should add a new backend implementation and preserve the
same runtime contracts, response shape, and WordPress write boundary.

The deterministic embedding provider exists for local tests only. Production
Site Knowledge uses the verified fixed profile and must not silently select an
unverified Provider Connection. Embedding endpoint credentials remain
Cloud-managed encrypted secrets and are not accepted from or returned to
WordPress.

Managed embedding provider calls are runtime-governed provider calls. When
Site Knowledge uses TEI, OpenAI, SiliconFlow, or another Cloud-managed
embedding adapter, Cloud records provider-call telemetry and usage meter events
on the owning runtime run with `ability_family=knowledge` and
`execution_kind=knowledge` or `embedding` as appropriate. This keeps vector
capability quota, cost, and audit behavior aligned with text, image, and search
runtime profiles instead of creating a separate vector billing path.

## Large Site Quotas

Sites with tens or hundreds of thousands of public posts can be indexed over
time, but they must not be pushed through one request or one worker run.

Cloud enforces two layers:

- per-run caps: stop one `site-knowledge-sync` run from embedding too much at
  once;
- per-site caps: stop one connected site from consuming unbounded vector
  storage and provider quota.

When a sync hits a limit, Cloud returns `status=completed` with
`progress.stage=limited`, `sync.skipped_documents`, and
`sync.skipped_due_to_quota`. The response also includes a `quota` object with
the active limits and utilization. Skipped content remains WordPress-owned and
can be indexed by later batches after quota or plan policy changes.

`site-knowledge-status` includes `coverage.quota`:

```json
{
  "status": "ok|near_limit|limited|empty",
  "indexed_documents": 10000,
  "indexed_chunks": 180000,
  "max_indexed_documents_per_site": 10000,
  "max_indexed_chunks_per_site": 200000,
  "max_sync_documents_per_run": 500,
  "max_sync_chunks_per_run": 5000,
  "document_utilization": 1.0,
  "chunk_utilization": 0.9,
  "skipped_due_to_quota": 0
}
```

Toolbox should continue to expose simple start/refresh/status actions. It may
display this quota detail, but it must not store vector provider credentials or
become the quota control plane.

## Source Types

Post and page content is supplied through `documents`. Comments are supplied
through `comments` and are ignored unless
`NPCINK_CLOUD_SITE_KNOWLEDGE_COMMENTS_ENABLED=true`.

Comment input must be bounded public data:

- `comment_id`
- `post_id`
- `comment_status`: `approved`, `approve`, or `1`
- `created_gmt`
- `url`
- `content_excerpt`
- `content_hash`

Cloud must not accept or store comment author email, IP address, user agent,
payment/contact identifiers, or WordPress credentials for Site Knowledge.

Stored chunks include:

- `source_type`: `post`, `page`, or `comment`
- `source_id`: post/page ID or comment ID
- `parent_post_id`: parent post ID for comments

Search defaults to `source_types=["post","page"]`. Callers must explicitly pass
`filters.source_types=["comment"]` or include `comment` in the list when a
workflow should use comments, such as FAQ or user-feedback analysis.

## Search Result Granularity

`site_knowledge_search.v1` accepts the optional additive input
`result_granularity`:

- `chunk` is the compatibility default and preserves ranked chunk results;
- `document` returns each public source document once after evidence filtering
  and reranking, then applies `max_results`.

Document results keep the best-ranked chunk as the primary evidence and add a
bounded `matched_chunks` list containing only `source_type`, `source_id`,
`chunk_index`, and `score`. They do not duplicate chunk text. The response also
returns `result_granularity` and `result_grouping` metadata, including
`duplicate_chunks_collapsed`, so consumers can verify that grouping occurred.

Cloud owns this grouping because it owns Site Knowledge search quality and
ranking. Toolbox and other consumers may request a granularity, but they must
not implement independent semantic dedupe or relevance scoring. Existing
callers that omit the field continue to receive chunk-level results.

Search also verifies that indexed chunks and the current query use the same
embedding space, identified as `provider_id:model_id`. Embeddings produced by
different models are different vector spaces and must not be compared, even
when their dimensions happen to match. Different providers may also apply
different pooling or normalization for the same advertised model ID, so a
matching model name alone is not sufficient. When the index contains another
embedding space, search fails closed with
`status=not_ready`, an empty `results` list, and additive
`retrieval_readiness.status=embedding_space_mismatch` diagnostics. The operator
action is to rebuild the Cloud-owned index with the current embedding space;
Cloud must not return low-confidence candidates from incompatible vectors.

## Product Workflows

`site-knowledge-search` remains one runtime ability. Product workflows are
selected through `input.intent`; Cloud does not register additional abilities or
write WordPress content.

Supported first workflows:

- `site_search`: site content Copilot. Results include `answer_source`,
  `copilot_action`, and `response_mode` so an assistant can answer with
  source-grounded site references.
- `faq_candidates`: FAQ candidate mining from public content and explicitly
  requested approved comments. Results include `faq_candidate`,
  `suggested_action`, and `faq_mode=wordpress_local_only`.
- `related_content`: topic cluster planning. Results include
  `cluster_candidate`, `cluster_role`, `planning_action`, and
  `planning_mode=wordpress_local_only`.
- `content_gap_analysis`: content coverage review. Results include
  `gap_signal`, `suggested_action`, and `planning_mode=wordpress_local_only`
  so editors can decide whether to expand existing content or create new
  coverage.
- `duplicate_check`: publish preflight conflict review. Results include
  `duplicate_check` with risk, signals, and local review guidance before a
  draft is created or published.
- `writing_context`: writer context enrichment. Results include
  `context_role`, `citation`, and `usage_guidance` so the local writing surface
  can show site-owned context before the writer drafts.
- `writing_support_plan`: writer preparation support. Results include
  `writing_support`, `pre_draft_tasks`, `evidence_source`,
  `planning_mode=wordpress_local_only`, and `blocked_outputs` so editors can
  move faster on source review, coverage decisions, internal links, and media
  follow-up without Cloud producing article titles, article bodies, SEO copy,
  `article_write_plan` candidates, full drafts, ready-to-publish content, or
  automatic publishing instructions.
- `internal_links`: editor link recommendation. Results include
  `anchor_text_candidates`, `link_target`, `suggested_action`, and
  `insert_mode=wordpress_local_only`.
- `refresh_suggestions`: stale/overlapping content review. Results include
  `refresh_action`, `refresh_signals`, `suggested_action`, and
  `update_mode=wordpress_local_only`. The same results include
  `duplicate_check` so generation flows can warn before drafting when a similar
  article already exists.

All workflow metadata is advisory. WordPress still owns insertion, edits,
publishing, and final user confirmation.

## WordPress AI Generation Reference

The existing `npcink-cloud/wp-ai-connector` runtime may optionally use Site
Knowledge as hidden context for title and summary tasks. The local Cloud Addon
owns this product eligibility and must explicitly send the task-bound mode:

```json
{
  "site_knowledge_reference": {
    "enabled": true,
    "mode": "site_title_style"
  }
}
```

The currently enabled task-to-mode mapping is:

- `title_generation` -> `site_title_style`
- `content_summary` -> `site_summary_style`

Cloud retains bounded compatibility validation and assembly policies for older
excerpt, meta-description, and classification modes, but the current Addon does
not send those modes. Compatibility support is not a quality claim and must not
be treated as product enablement or inferred from generic task metadata.

This is an additive runtime hint inside the existing scene request, not a new
ability, workflow, prompt registry, or Cloud-side preference truth. Cloud uses
the current scene prompt as a bounded `writing_context` query, then assembles an
internal `generation_context.v1` pack. The pack is provider-input detail only;
it is not accepted from callers and is not returned to WordPress AI users.

The internal task policies are deliberately bounded:

| Task | Minimum score | Source posts | References | Context characters |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| title | 0.35 | 6 | 1 aggregate profile | 400 |
| summary | 0.35 | 5 | 1 aggregate profile | 400 |

Results are relevance-filtered, deduplicated by post, and checked for a strong
content-fingerprint overlap with the current scene before projection. Title
generation derives its aggregate profile from related historical titles;
summary generation currently derives its aggregate profile from the stored
excerpts of related public posts. Both profiles contain only qualitative
short/medium/long preference, sentence shape, and qualitative question-mark and
colon usage. Exact sample counts, lengths, rates, historical text, source
chunks, scores, URLs, and evidence details are not placed in provider input or
the WordPress AI result.

The provider instruction treats the profile only as a soft style preference.
It must not introduce facts absent from the current scene input. Summary
reference remains a controlled opt-in trial: limited local paired evaluation
supported enabling it, but that evidence is not a general quality guarantee.
Any additional task must have task-appropriate source evidence and pass a new
paired quality gate before the local Addon enables it. Missing, insufficient,
filtered, or unavailable Site Knowledge silently falls back to ordinary
generation. Bounded provider metadata
records only the context contract, status, reason, mode, reference count, and
character count for runtime quality diagnosis; it does not contain source text,
scores, URLs, or taxonomy details. The WordPress AI result remains the task's
ordinary reviewable result with `suggestion_only` posture and no WordPress write
authority.

The local Cloud Addon owns the enable/disable preference and transmits it on
each eligible request. Cloud does not persist or expose a second setting for
this preference.

## Agent Handoff

`site-knowledge-search` now returns an additive `agent_handoff` object. This is
the first bounded Agentic handoff shape for:

```text
site_knowledge -> suggestion_only -> local proposal
```

The handoff's static identity and boundary fields come from the Cloud read-only
Agent/Workflow metadata projection. Runtime evidence and proposal inputs remain
in the existing runtime result.

The handoff is not a new Cloud Agent platform, writable registry, route,
workflow truth, or WordPress write authority. It is a structured local handoff
hint embedded in the existing runtime result.

For proposal-capable intents, such as `content_gap_analysis`, `internal_links`,
`refresh_suggestions`, `faq_candidates`, `related_content`, `duplicate_check`,
and `writing_support_plan`, the handoff uses:

```json
{
  "agent_id": "site_knowledge_suggestion_agent",
  "agent_version": "site_knowledge_agent.v1",
  "handoff_type": "proposal_input",
  "handoff_owner": "wordpress_local",
  "requires_local_approval": true,
  "write_posture": "suggestion_only",
  "direct_wordpress_write": false,
  "proposal_input": {
    "source": "site_knowledge",
    "workflow": "content_gap_analysis",
    "cloud_output": "gap_evidence",
    "local_next_action": "review_content_gap_before_local_plan",
    "evidence_refs": []
  }
}
```

For read/display intents such as `site_search` and `writing_context`, the
handoff remains `suggestion_only` and `proposal_input` is empty.

`evidence_refs` intentionally carries compact source references, not full chunks
or raw provider payloads. Local Core may use it to construct or prefill a local
proposal, but final approval, preflight, audit, and WordPress writes remain
local.

## Evidence Gate

Search callers may pass an optional `evidence_policy` object:

```json
{
  "evidence_policy": {
    "min_score": 0.25,
    "required_sources": 1,
    "no_hit_policy": "abstain"
  }
}
```

Cloud applies the policy before returning results. Results below `min_score` do
not count as grounding evidence. The response includes:

```json
{
  "evidence_gate": {
    "status": "passed|insufficient_evidence",
    "min_score": 0.25,
    "required_sources": 1,
    "source_count": 1,
    "no_hit_policy": "abstain",
    "allows_site_grounded_assertion": true,
    "guidance": "Use returned site sources as grounding evidence."
  }
}
```

Default policy is `min_score=0.25`, `required_sources=1`, and
`no_hit_policy=abstain`. If the gate returns `insufficient_evidence`, AI
callers must not invent site-specific facts. They should abstain, ask for more
source material, return an empty grounded answer, or use general knowledge only
when the caller explicitly allowed a non-site-grounded fallback.

## Coverage Semantics

`post_type_coverage` is MVP Cloud-seen coverage. It reports coverage for post
types present in the Cloud index, not authoritative whole-site WordPress
coverage. Whole-site coverage requires the WordPress side to provide source
totals in a later contract.

## Anti-Hallucination Roadmap

The current implementation follows
[`site-knowledge-anti-hallucination-roadmap-v1.md`](site-knowledge-anti-hallucination-roadmap-v1.md):
first establish a real vector evidence loop, then add lightweight ontology read
models such as topic clusters, entities, FAQ candidates, content relationships,
and category/tag mappings. Heavy graph infrastructure and new orchestration
systems remain deferred.

## Real-Chain Smoke

Use the local real-chain smoke after the fixed embedding profile has passed its
Admin probe and the deployment-managed Zilliz connection is ready:

```bash
pnpm run smoke:site-knowledge
```

The smoke validates the running dev `api` and `worker` containers with the
current Cloud env:

- `zilliz_cloud` vector backend
- `BAAI/bge-m3` embeddings through the configured Cloud embedding provider
- queued `site-knowledge-sync` processed by the runtime worker
- inline `site-knowledge-search` with `evidence_gate.status=passed`
- inline `site-knowledge-status` reporting indexed chunks
- `suggestion_only` and `direct_wordpress_write=false`

Smoke evidence is written under `.tmp/site-knowledge-real-chain-smoke/` and must
not be committed. Evidence contains only redacted configuration and pass/fail
counts; it must not include provider keys, Cloud secrets, raw embeddings, query
text, or chunk text.
