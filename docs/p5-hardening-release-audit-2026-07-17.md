# P5 Hardening And Release Audit — 2026-07-17

## Status

P5-A audit complete; global P5 release closure incomplete.

This is a requirement-to-evidence and gap record. It is not production
approval, a deployment record, a penetration test, a production SLO, or proof
that P1, P2, or P5 exited.

Audit input revision: `22eff1e0f455` on
`codex/p4-portal-context-contraction`. The P4 input revision was pushed to
GitHub before this audit. The P5-A documentation and contract changes belong to
the commit containing this record.

## Boundary And Non-goals

- Cloud remains hosted runtime, provider/runtime configuration, usage,
  entitlement, temporary-artifact, health, and diagnostic truth only.
- WordPress/Core remains the permission, ability, workflow, prompt, review,
  approval, apply, final-audit, and CMS-write owner.
- Media delivery acknowledgement remains transfer evidence only.
- Redis, queues, callbacks, buffers, and projections remain non-canonical.
- This audit does not add Typecho, Z-BlogPHP, Ghost, audio/video/document
  processors, a new queue, scheduler, workflow engine, registry, or control
  plane.
- No production deploy, paid-provider execution, credential rotation, or
  production cleanup enablement occurred.

## Phase Status

| Phase | Status | Current authoritative conclusion |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | substantially complete | Target contracts, ADR-004, deletion inventory, baseline, and executable target-contract checks exist. Phase-level plans do not substitute for later exit evidence. |
| P1 | incomplete | `site_url`, `platform_kind=wordpress`, and runtime responsibility extraction are implemented. The superseded connector marker and operator-only `P1-E05`/`P1-E06` evidence remain open. |
| P2 | incomplete | The current Cloud/Add-on contracts support title, summary, and selected-text rewrite, but no current exact-package WordPress request/review/apply record covers all three tasks and their failure/idempotency posture. |
| P3 | complete for the bounded media milestone | P3-B5 records exact packages, fresh WordPress E2E, bounded memory, security, recovery, old-alias deletion, a six-repository matrix, and independent review. Current P5 still needs a replay against current revisions. |
| P4 | complete | The Portal/Admin inventory, destructive contraction, strict clients, fail-closed authorization, hot-path cleanup, focused gates, and screenshot-backed browser evidence are recorded. |
| P5 | incomplete | Dependency/security blockers, load/soak evidence, current exact bundle, current text/media WordPress acceptance, current matrix, restore rehearsal, release-policy proof, and the final audit remain open. |

## Structural Remeasurement

Commands were rerun against `app` and `tests` at the audit input revision. Raw
matching-line counts are not defect counts; every nonzero result was manually
classified.

| Marker | 2026-07-14 baseline | 2026-07-17 result | Classification |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `wordpress_url` | 99 | 0 | Canonical site-field cutover is complete in active code/tests. |
| superseded connector markers | 17 | 36 | Blocking regression/unfinished cutover: 7 active `app` lines and 29 active tests still use `wp_ai_connector_runtime.v1`. |
| `blob_data` | 20 | 0 | Active media blob path removed. Historical migrations are outside this counter. |
| `_source_bytes_b64` / `_watermark_bytes_b64` | 4 | 0 | Internal runtime Base64 byte path removed; bounded provider-edge conversion remains separately allowed. |
| old public/playback token markers | 22 | 6 | One deny-projection field and five rejection/removal tests; no active old route or token truth was found. |

The superseded connector count above is the clean `22eff1e0` input revision.
The P5-A working tree adds one negative marker to
`test_refactor_target_contract.py` so the final raw working-tree count is 37:
7 active `app` lines, 29 pre-existing active-test lines, and 1 audit-owned
rejection marker. The extra static marker is not an accepted runtime contract.

Module-size observations:

| File | Baseline lines | Current lines | Interpretation |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `app/domain/runtime/service.py` | 8,772 | 6,236 | Responsibilities have been extracted behind one facade; size alone is not phase-exit proof. |
| `app/api/routes/portal.py` | 3,864 | 4,574 | Security, serializers, and explicit-context work increased the file; raw growth is not automatically debt. |
| `app/api/routes/service.py` | 5,214 | 5,205 | Essentially unchanged by line count; P4 hot-path ownership was verified behaviorally. |

## Blocking Gaps

### P1 Connector Identity

The active public runtime uses `cloud_connector_runtime.v1` plus
`wordpress_operation.v1`, but hosted runtime profiles still expose and enforce
`connector_contract_version=wp_ai_connector_runtime.v1` in Admin service
models, catalog defaults, managed policy, and active tests. This contradicts
`CON-01`, `P1-E02`, `NO_COMPATIBILITY_LAYER`, and
`ONE_ACTIVE_CONTRACT_VERSION`.

Required resolution is an atomic contract batch: choose the one current
connector identity, update producers, consumers, Admin/frontend projections,
fixtures, tests, and current docs together, then prove the superseded active
marker search is empty. Do not preserve an alias or fallback.

### P1 Operator Evidence

`P1-E05` production title execution and `P1-E06` configuration/data
inventory-backup-restore are explicitly operator-only pending in the active
runbook. Local pytest or an older WordPress smoke cannot close them. Production
execution requires separate operator approval and secret handling under the
release policy.

### P2 Current WordPress Text Loop

Current automated contracts cover `title_generation`, `content_summary`, and
`content_rewrite`, with rewrite scoped to the selected source text. Existing
real WordPress records are historical or do not cover all of:

- the current `cloud_connector_runtime.v1 + wordpress_operation.v1` path;
- local review and apply for all three tasks;
- Cloud performing no WordPress write;
- idempotent replay and no duplicate local apply;
- auth, entitlement, provider, and idempotency-conflict failure evidence;
- explicit local/offline/privacy fallback posture.

### P5 Performance And Release Evidence

Existing hot-query, media-corpus, bounded-memory, media E2E, failure-drill,
bundle, and release-policy tools are reusable. They do not yet provide current
revision evidence for concurrent runtime load, queue bursts, long-running soak,
text-path latency, exact deploy-bundle replay, restore, or the final clean
six-repository matrix.

The canonical matrix repository is
`/Users/muze/gitee/npcink-workflow-toolbox`. Its default Cloud gate is only
`check:fast`; P5 must run `check:seam`, `check:perimeter`,
`check:anti-drift`, and `lint` separately.

## Security And Dependency Audit

### Release blockers

1. Python environment audit found eight known vulnerabilities in Pillow
   `12.2.0`; every advisory names `12.3.0` as the fix. Cloud decodes untrusted
   uploaded/provider image data, so this is not treated as an irrelevant
   transitive finding. The minimum isolated fix is `Pillow>=12.3,<13` plus a
   refreshed `uv.lock`, full dependency audit, focused media/security tests,
   and the representative corpus.
2. `admin_session_secret` is the first-choice root for both Admin session JWTs
   and persistent/runtime encryption purposes, including callback secrets,
   site signing material, Addon connection payloads, Portal idempotency
   responses, and runtime execution input. Provider-connection and service-
   setting secrets are already isolated under `service_settings_secret` and
   are explicitly outside this migration. The remaining reuse expands one
   compromise domain and makes ordinary Admin-session rotation able to strand
   durable ciphertext. Introduce a dedicated runtime-data encryption secret
   through an inventoried, backed-up, one-time re-encryption cutover; remove the
   temporary old-key read path before the batch exits. Do not keep a permanent
   dual-key compatibility fallback.

Pillow audit reproduction:

- UTC time: `2026-07-17T12:39:09Z`;
- environment: Python `3.12.10`, Pillow `12.2.0`;
- tool: `pip-audit 2.10.1`;
- command: `uvx pip-audit --path .venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages`;
- result: failed with eight findings, all fixed by `12.3.0`;
- advisory IDs: `PYSEC-2026-2253`, `PYSEC-2026-2255`,
  `PYSEC-2026-2257`, `PYSEC-2026-2256`, `PYSEC-2026-2254`,
  `PYSEC-2026-3453`, `PYSEC-2026-3451`, and `PYSEC-2026-3452`.

The tool also skipped the local unpublished project package
`npcink-ai-cloud==0.1.0`; that skip does not affect the Pillow finding and is
retained as an audit limitation.

### Follow-up hardening

- Root and frontend production `pnpm audit` reported no known vulnerabilities.
- The five WordPress repositories have no production Composer packages to
  audit; absence of packages is not a dev-tool or source-security assessment.
- Root and frontend lock synchronization currently checks dependency presence,
  not exact specifiers, resolved versions, peer graph, or overrides.
- Dependency audits are not release-blocking CI gates, and Dependabot entries
  currently set `open-pull-requests-limit: 0`.
- The reviewed secret-scan baseline still reports one private-key fixture in
  payment-gateway tests. It needs one precise fixture allowlist/baseline entry,
  not a broad private-key exclusion.
- `docker-compose.runtime.yml` binds the application to loopback, while
  `docker-compose.prod.yml` defaults port 8010 to all interfaces. The latter
  must bind loopback or be renamed/documented and guarded as a local build
  surface before release.
- Portal/Admin cookie JWT decoders should explicitly require their complete
  claim sets, matching the stricter bearer decoder, with missing-claim tests.
- A global sensitive-log regression gate remains absent. Authorization,
  cookies, provider URL queries, and secret-bearing fields need one bounded
  redaction contract.
- No independent penetration test, container-image CVE scan, production-config
  verification, or online-credential validation was performed in P5-A.

### Already covered

Existing focused tests and contracts cover HMAC body/timestamp/nonce/replay,
site and key status, Portal membership and selected-site isolation, Admin proxy
allowlisting before internal-token injection, durable Portal idempotency,
site-scoped media signed pull and ACK, bounded media validation, and default-off
fenced orphan cleanup. These controls reduce risk but do not waive the blockers
above.

## Cross-repository Snapshot

The read-only status snapshot used locally cached upstream information; no
fetch was performed.

| Repository | Revision | Branch | Status at snapshot |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `npcink-abilities-toolkit` | `77321e8b4f75` | `master` | clean |
| `npcink-governance-core` | `af0e5128decb` | `master` | clean |
| `npcink-ai-client-adapter` | `60b90fa71ce5` | `master` | clean |
| `npcink-workflow-toolbox` | `2c75273cb717` | `master` | clean |
| `npcink-cloud-addon` | `b74d4c3c4a78` | `master` | clean |
| `npcink-ai-cloud` | `22eff1e0f455` | `codex/p4-portal-context-contraction` | clean before P5-A edits |

`composer quality:matrix` was used only for status inspection. The final
`composer quality:matrix:run -- --fail-on-dirty` remains pending until the
current Cloud batch is committed and all P1/P2 blockers are resolved.

## Provisional P5 Load Gate

The load harness does not yet exist. Its first implementation must use a
disposable local/staging environment and a deterministic fake provider by
default. Real-provider calls remain a small, separately approved smoke.

Initial provisional thresholds:

- unexpected HTTP 5xx, cross-site leakage, duplicate side effects, and
  non-governed WordPress writes: zero;
- accepted fake-provider run completion: at least 99%;
- provider-excluded API p95 at most 500 ms and p99 at most 1 s, with no
  regression greater than both 20% and 100 ms against the locked baseline;
- representative high-cardinality hot-query p95 at most 50 ms with required
  indexes and no unexplained full scan;
- steady queue-wait p95 at most two current poll intervals, with burst queues
  fully drained and no abnormal queued/running/dispatching residue;
- after warm-up, soak RSS growth at most 10%, with no monotonic FD or DB
  connection growth and artifact/queue counts returning to baseline;
- retain the accepted P3 media streaming, corpus, and maximum-image memory
  bounds unchanged.

These are engineering acceptance candidates, not production SLOs. Freeze them
only after three comparable local/staging baselines record dataset,
concurrency, duration, environment, revision, and complete warnings.

## Ordered Follow-up Batches

1. **P5-B1 connector cutover:** remove the active superseded connector marker
   atomically and rerun P1 searches and focused Cloud/Admin/Add-on contracts.
2. **P5-B2 security blockers:** update Pillow and separate runtime-data
   encryption through a backed-up one-time cutover, in separate reviewable
   commits.
3. **P5-B3 WordPress text acceptance:** package current components and prove
   title, summary, and selected-text rewrite through local governance.
4. **P5-B4 load/soak:** add the smallest deterministic harness, capture
   before/after API/query/queue/worker/memory evidence, and tune only measured
   bottlenecks in the existing stack.
5. **P5-B5 release closure:** run every Cloud/plugin gate, exact bundle replay,
   current media/text acceptance, restore rehearsal, clean central matrix,
   release-policy check, independent review, and the final requirement-to-
   evidence audit.

P5 remains incomplete until every blocker is closed or an explicit accepted
exception names its owner, scope, evidence, and rollback.

## Subsequent Batch Status

The phase table and findings above remain the authoritative snapshot of input
revision `22eff1e0f455`; they are not rewritten after the fact. The following
later engineering batches changed the current branch status:

| Batch | Current result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P5-B1 connector cutover | engineering complete | [P5-B1 Hosted Profile Contract Cutover](p5-b1-hosted-profile-contract-cutover-2026-07-17.md) |
| P5-B2 security blockers | engineering complete | [P5-B2 Security Hardening Closeout](p5-b2-security-hardening-2026-07-17.md) and [ADR-019](decisions/019-dedicated-runtime-data-encryption-domain.md) |
| P5-B3 WordPress text acceptance | engineering complete | [P5-B3 WordPress Text Acceptance Closeout](p5-b3-wordpress-ai-text-acceptance-2026-07-18.md): exact revisions and packages passed Fresh data-path, browser review/apply, deterministic offline, provider/run-metadata, package, six-repository matrix, and cleanup evidence; summary/rewrite equality remains an explicit provider-quality limitation, and this is not production or Core-audit approval |
| P5-B4 load/soak | pending | deterministic concurrent runtime, queue burst, query, worker, memory, and soak evidence remains required |
| P5-B5 release closure | pending | exact bundle, media/text replay, restore, complete security follow-ups, central matrix, release-policy proof, and final audit remain required |

P5-B2 removes the two release blockers recorded in **Security And Dependency
Audit**: Pillow is at the fixed floor with blocking default/Zilliz dependency
audits, and the five persisted runtime-data types use a dedicated fail-closed
encryption domain with an offline transactional cutover. This is engineering
evidence only. No production cutover, production approval, penetration test,
complete image CVE scan, or live-credential validation has occurred, and global
P5 remains incomplete.

P5-B3 closes only the current WordPress text contract/UI/write-loop acceptance
on its recorded revisions and package hashes. Its provider-quality limitation
is retained rather than rerun away; P5-B4 load/soak and P5-B5 release closure
remain pending, so global P5 is still incomplete.
