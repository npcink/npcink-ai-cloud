# Payment Gateway Contract v1

Status: active

This contract defines the boundary between Magick AI Cloud payment orders and
external payment providers.

The code truth is `app/domain/commercial/payment_gateways.py`.

## Boundary

The gateway layer owns provider-specific order creation, payment callback
verification, refund creation, and refund callback verification.

The commercial service still owns:

- payment order persistence;
- subscription activation;
- credit pack grants;
- refund adjustments;
- audit events;
- credit ledger writes.

Do not let Alipay, WeChat Pay, SDK callback payloads, or signing details leak
into credit ledger or entitlement logic.

## Provider Contract

Every provider must implement:

- `create_order(request)`: returns `external_order_no`, optional `checkout_url`,
  and provider metadata.
- `verify_payment_callback(payload)`: returns normalized order number, trade
  number, event id, amount, status, and occurred time.
- `create_refund(request)`: returns `external_refund_no` and provider metadata.
- `verify_refund_callback(payload)`: returns normalized refund number, provider
  refund number, event id, amount, status, and occurred time.

Supported provider keys are:

- `alipay`
- `wechat_pay`
- `manual`

`wechat` and `wxpay` are accepted aliases for `wechat_pay`.

## Current Provider Mode

Providers currently run in simulated mode. They create local payment/refund
records and expose normalized callback parsing, but they do not call real Alipay
or WeChat Pay APIs yet.

Real provider integration must replace only the provider implementation behind
this contract. It must not change the payment order, credit pack, or credit
ledger state machine.
