# Media Derivative Operations Runbook v1

Status: active Cloud guidance; WordPress end-to-end smoke pending connector adoption
Date: 2026-06-03

## Scope

This runbook covers Cloud-side `media_job_request.v1` image processing through
the versioned `image.transform.v1` operation.

Cloud remains a runtime service only. It produces temporary derivative
artifacts and bounded processing evidence. WordPress writes, attachment
metadata changes, replacement decisions, proposal approval, preflight, audit,
and rollback authority stay in the local WordPress/Core path.

## Runtime Flow

1. A local host/addon streams one `media_upload_request.v1` multipart request
   to `POST /v1/runtime/media/uploads` using one `request` field and one `file`.
2. Cloud validates the source and returns a same-site temporary source
   `artifact_id` with operation `image.upload.v1`.
3. The host submits `media_job_request.v1` to `POST /v1/runtime/media/jobs`
   with that source ID, optional separately uploaded watermark artifact ID,
   strict transform parameters, and `operation=image.transform.v1`.
4. Cloud checks artifact ownership, lifecycle, remaining TTL, format,
   dimensions, quality, result TTL, crop, and watermark intent, then queues a
   normal runtime worker job using the existing FastAPI,
   Postgres, Redis, and worker stack.
5. The worker produces a short-lived derivative artifact and a
   `media_derivative_job_metrics` row.
6. The local host/addon previews the derivative through its own controlled
   signed proxy.
7. Core receives a proposal payload and remains the only approval and
   WordPress write owner.
8. Cloud exposes read-only admin/portal observability for processing health.

The workflow display metadata for this flow is sourced from the Cloud read-only
Agent/Workflow metadata projection as `media_derivative_artifact_generation`.
Runtime artifact data and approval/write decisions remain outside that
projection.

## Deployment Checklist

Before enabling the feature:

1. Deploy the API and worker from the same revision.
2. Run migrations:

   ```bash
   docker exec npcink-ai-cloud-api-1 alembic upgrade head
   ```

3. Confirm these migrations are present:

   - `20260603_0036_media_derivative_job_metrics`
   - `20260714_0061_local_volume_artifact_store`

4. Restart the runtime worker after migration:

   ```bash
   docker restart npcink-ai-cloud-worker-1
   ```

5. After the WordPress connector adopts both resources, run the WordPress smoke:

   ```bash
   pnpm run smoke:media-derivative:wp
   ```

Until that connector batch lands, this smoke is not current P3-B3A acceptance
evidence. Expected future smoke evidence:

- local batch planning returns a candidate with Cloud request input and a
  `batch_size_recommendation`;
- derivative preview succeeds;
- Core proposal is created and approved;
- attachment URL changes after adoption;
- page hard-coded references no longer contain the old URL;
- option/theme-mod reference repair succeeds;
- rollback history is present;
- `media_derivative_job_metrics` contains the succeeded run;
- `media_artifacts` contains an available short-lived artifact with
  `operation = 'image.transform.v1'`; bytes live in the shared ArtifactStore
  volume rather than PostgreSQL.

## Orphan Cleanup Enablement Gate

`NPCINK_CLOUD_ARTIFACT_ORPHAN_CLEANUP_ENABLED` defaults to `false`. This
repository change does not authorize or record enabling it in production.
Before changing that setting, operators must verify all of the following:

1. Migration `20260716_0066_media_artifact_orphan_reconciliation` is applied
   and its rollback path is known.
2. Run `pnpm run check:artifact-orphan-isolation-proof` and require aggregate
   `P3-B4C3 PASS`. The isolated gate proves PostgreSQL major 16, migration head
   `20260716_0066`, two simultaneously live app-container connections,
   PostgreSQL claim/CAS fencing, cross-container publication locking, and two
   complete passes over a Compose-project-owned named volume with a safety
   window of at least 3,600 seconds. SQLite and a local temporary directory are
   not sufficient production-concurrency evidence. Passing this proof does not
   enable production cleanup; it only satisfies this checklist item.
3. The artifact root, both shard levels, `.artifact-publication.lock`,
   `.artifact-store-bootstrap.lock`, `.artifact-store-generation`, and artifact
   files are owned by the service account. Root/shards/files are not group- or
   world-writable; both locks and the generation marker are private `0600`
   regular single-link files. The bootstrap lock is used only for generation
   initialization and is not held across a database transaction.
4. The mounted root is stable for the process lifetime. No deployment,
   sidecar, maintenance script, or operator replaces the mount, root, shard,
   publication lock, bootstrap lock, or marker in place.
5. Every process that publishes or mutates the artifact namespace uses the
   shared publication session. `flock` is advisory and does not stop a writer
   that ignores the protocol; the design does not defend against a malicious
   same-UID process.
6. Two default-off cadence observations are reviewed first. Aggregate
   conservation holds, errors expose no key/path/token/claim, and retry/fence
   busy counts are understood.
7. A rollback can immediately set cleanup back to `false` without disabling
   read-only reconciliation or TTL purge.

Enable one ops worker only for the first controlled validation. Watch
`cleanup_candidates_eligible`, `candidates_claimed`, `candidates_deleted`,
`candidates_invalidated`, `retry_scheduled`, `stale_claims_reclaimed`,
`superseded_finalizations`, and `cleanup_fence_busy`. These are aggregate
runtime facts; they are not CMS apply/write evidence.

## Observability

Admin route:

- `/internal/service/admin/media-observability`

Portal route:

- `/portal/v1/sites/{site_id}/media-observability`

Primary fields:

- `jobs_total`
- `succeeded_total`
- `failed_total`
- `success_rate`
- `avg_processing_duration_ms`
- `p95_processing_duration_ms`
- `avg_queue_wait_ms`
- `source_bytes_total`
- `output_bytes_total`
- `bytes_saved_total`
- `active_artifact_count`
- `active_artifact_bytes`
- `delivery_started_count`
- `delivery_stream_completed_count`
- `delivery_acknowledged_count`
- `stream_completion_rate`
- `acknowledgement_rate`
- `watermark_job_count`

Operator interpretation:

- `failed_total > 0`: inspect `errors` and `recent_failures`.
- Low `success_rate`: check unsupported formats, decode failures, oversized
  uploads, and animated inputs.
- High `p95_processing_duration_ms`: check source dimensions, worker CPU, and
  queue pressure.
- High `active_artifact_bytes`: verify cleanup worker cadence and TTL bounds.
- Low `stream_completion_rate`: inspect interrupted, truncated, checksum-failed,
  or unavailable artifact streams.
- Low `acknowledgement_rate`: the connector may not be confirming verified
  receipt after completed streams. ACK is receipt evidence only, not proof of
  review, import, attachment, publication, or another CMS write.

The summary contract is `magick-media-observability-summary-v2`. Delivery
evidence is grouped by artifact `operation`, site, and UTC delivery-start cohort
date. Portal responses are site-scoped and omit cross-site job summaries; their
delivery breakdown is constrained to the authorized site.

| --- | --- | --- |
| `media_derivative.artifact_not_found` | Artifact id is unknown for the site | Regenerate preview |
| `media_derivative.artifact_expired` | Artifact TTL has elapsed | Regenerate preview before proposing/adopting |

## Compatibility Notes

Expected behavior:

- EXIF orientation is applied before crop, resize, and output.
- Aspect-ratio crop runs before max-width resize and records a processing
  warning when pixels are cropped.
- CMYK or palette-like inputs are converted to web-safe output modes when
  needed.
- JPEG output flattens alpha and records a warning.
- Every output, including `original`, always re-encodes through Pillow so
  EXIF/GPS/ICC metadata is not passed through. `original` preserves a supported
  still-image format when possible.
- Upload and worker decode admission is capped at 8,192 pixels per axis and
  16,777,216 pixels total, equivalent to one 64 MiB RGBA decode surface before
  crop, resize, watermark, and encoder buffers.
- Animated sources are rejected instead of silently flattening the first frame.

## Production Guardrails

- Keep artifact TTL between 15 and 60 minutes.
- Do not expose artifact blob data in admin or portal observability.
- Do not return WordPress write decisions from Cloud responses.
- Do not add a Cloud media registry or Cloud ability registry.
- Do not replace the current FastAPI, Postgres, Redis, worker architecture with
  Temporal, Celery, RabbitMQ, Kafka, or Kubernetes-first infrastructure.
