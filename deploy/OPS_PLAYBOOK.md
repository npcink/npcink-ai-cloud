## Purpose

This playbook is the minimum operator contract for Npcink AI Cloud production work.
If a release depends on manual knowledge that is not written here, the release is not closed.

Primary internal checkpoints:

- `GET /health/live`
- `GET /health/ready`
- `GET /health/operational-ready`
- `GET /internal/service/observability/summary`
- `GET /internal/service/ops/cadence`
- `GET /internal/service/runtime/diagnostics/summary`
- `GET /internal/service/runtime/diagnostics/backlog`
- signed `GET /v1/catalog/models`
- signed `POST /v1/runtime/execute`
- signed `GET /v1/runs/{run_id}`
- signed `GET /v1/runs/{run_id}/result`
- signed `GET /v1/stats/profiles/{profile_id}`
- signed `GET /v1/usage/summary`

## Environment Entry Points

Cloud has two operator-known public entry points in the current deployment
model:

- local development: `http://127.0.0.1:8010/`
- production: `https://cloud.npc.ink/`

Configuration ownership:

- local compose may use the loopback origin for development and smoke testing.
- production must set `NPCINK_CLOUD_BASE_URL=https://cloud.npc.ink` in
  `.env.deploy` or the deploy secret store.
- production Runtime Compose must set `NPCINK_CLOUD_EXTERNAL_EDGE_READY=true`
  and `NPCINK_CLOUD_DOMAIN_NAME=cloud.npc.ink`. The base URL must use HTTPS and
  its host must exactly match `NPCINK_CLOUD_DOMAIN_NAME`.
- production must set
  `NPCINK_CLOUD_BROWSER_ORIGIN_ALLOWLIST=https://cloud.npc.ink` and
  `NPCINK_CLOUD_TRUSTED_HOST_ALLOWLIST=cloud.npc.ink`.
- production must keep `NPCINK_CLOUD_RUNTIME_DATA_ENCRYPTION_SECRET` and
  `NPCINK_CLOUD_RUNTIME_DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY_ID` stable across ordinary deploys.
  They belong only to the four backend writers; the frontend receives neither.
- `/admin/service-settings` owns Portal public URL, QQ login, and SMTP sender
  settings. Do not move those service settings back into `.env`.

Loopback origins are a development convenience only. If a production frontend
requires `http://127.0.0.1:8010` or `localhost` as a public URL, treat that as a
release-blocking environment configuration error.

### External Edge and bundled NGINX

Production has one public chain:

```text
client -> operator-owned TLS Edge -> 127.0.0.1:8010 bundled NGINX -> Gunicorn
```

The external Edge owns public `80/443`, certificates, TLS policy, DNS, and any
WAF/source restriction. It must replace client-supplied `X-Real-IP`,
`X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Forwarded-Proto`, `X-Forwarded-Host`, and
`X-Forwarded-Port` values. The bundled NGINX trusts client-address evidence
only from the Compose gateway `172.28.0.1` and sets the upstream
`X-Forwarded-For` to `$remote_addr`; Gunicorn trusts forwarded headers only
from NGINX at `172.28.0.10`.

The exact-bundle smoke may replay the artifact through loopback NGINX over
plain HTTP. That is a local verification exception, never a production public
origin.

For the first migration from the retired bundled edge:

1. Retain the previous bundle and matched database recovery point while the old
   Caddy route remains active.
2. Preinstall host NGINX and `curl`, then run
   `deploy/bind-domain-to-ssh-host.sh --prepare-only`. Require private-key
   permission validation, certificate/key matching, loopback-upstream health,
   and `nginx -t`; this mode must not install packages, start, or restart host
   NGINX.
3. Record and stop only the running Caddy container IDs selected by both
   `com.docker.compose.project=${NPCINK_CLOUD_COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME}` and
   `com.docker.compose.service=caddy` labels.
4. Rerun the binding helper without `--prepare-only`. It must reject a still
   running project Caddy, activate host NGINX, and pass the loopback-resolved
   public HTTPS health check before the readiness acknowledgement is set.
5. Run the normal release loader and require its marker
   `[ok] Retired bundle services are absent: caddy jaeger otel-collector`
   before public health verification.
6. Confirm no current Compose-project container is named for `caddy`, `jaeger`,
   or `otel-collector`, then verify public HTTPS, operational readiness, signed
   runtime, and media upload/download controls.

The binding helper restores prior host NGINX files and service state when its
activation fails. Before the loader runs, rollback is `stop host NGINX ->
restart only the recorded Caddy IDs`. After the loader starts, rollback is
`stop the new project -> stop host NGINX -> restore the matched prior bundle
and database recovery point when required`. The loader uses Compose orphan
removal and fails closed on any residual retired service. Never leave both
Caddy and host NGINX active, and never attach retired observability containers
to the current release project.

## Signed Runtime Smoke Semantics

The formal release smoke follows the current hosted runtime contract. It does
not call retired `/v1/addon/*` projection surfaces.

Operator interpretation rules:

- `site_id / key_id / secret` identify a real provisioned, active site API key.
- signed `GET /v1/catalog/models` confirms the public catalog read path.
- signed `POST /v1/runtime/execute` confirms the production provider
  configuration can execute a real hosted runtime request.
- signed `GET /v1/runs/{run_id}` and `/result` confirm run lookup and result
  retrieval through the current runtime contract.
- signed `GET /v1/stats/profiles/{profile_id}` and `/v1/usage/summary` confirm
  runtime detail and usage evidence remain readable.
- missing signed runtime credentials are a release-blocking configuration error.

Manual refresh guidance:

- WordPress local refresh actions must remain local cache or service-status
  reads only.
- Release evidence must come from the signed runtime smoke and internal
  observability endpoints, not from retired addon projection endpoints.
- If runtime smoke fails, inspect provider health, site/key lifecycle,
  entitlement, and runtime worker logs before changing WordPress-side controls.

## Secret Rotation

### Admin bootstrap token

1. Generate a new `NPCINK_CLOUD_ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN`.
2. Update the deploy secret store.
3. Restart `api`.
4. Verify `POST /admin/auth/bootstrap` succeeds with the new token and fails with the old token.
5. Record the rotation window in operator notes.

### Internal service token

1. Generate a new `NPCINK_CLOUD_INTERNAL_AUTH_TOKEN`.
2. Update the deploy secret store for `api`, `frontend`, `worker`, `callback-worker`, and `ops-worker`.
3. Restart those services together.
4. Verify `GET /health/ready` and `GET /internal/service/observability/summary` with the new token.
5. Verify old-token requests fail closed.

### Session invalidation

1. Rotate `NPCINK_CLOUD_ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET` to invalidate `/admin/*` sessions.
2. Rotate `NPCINK_CLOUD_PORTAL_JWT_SECRET` to invalidate `/portal/*` sessions.
3. Restart `api` and `frontend`.
4. Verify stale cookies no longer access `/admin/session` or `/portal/v1/session`.

### Runtime-data encryption key cutover

`NPCINK_CLOUD_RUNTIME_DATA_ENCRYPTION_SECRET` is not an ordinary rotatable
configuration value. Never update it or
`NPCINK_CLOUD_RUNTIME_DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY_ID` through the normal secret-rotation
or deploy-and-restart path. A direct change can strand persisted ciphertext.

Use a planned maintenance window and a bundle-backed staged release. Extract
and load the release bundle first, then work from its staged release directory;
do not switch `current` yet. The staged `docker-compose.runtime.yml` must resolve
`api` to the newly loaded release image. The maintenance command runs inside
that image and does not require Python or application source on the host.

1. Record the current release revision, current key ID, database target, staged
   release path, and rollback owner. Keep the old code and old decryption key
   material available from the protected operator secret store; do not place a
   key value in shell history, command arguments, logs, or Git.
2. A pure bundle does not contain `.env.deploy`. Before any Compose command,
   copy it from the protected shared source, falling back to the protected
   current release copy, and verify mode `0600`. Do not call
   `deploy/deploy-to-ssh-host.sh`, `deploy/remote-load-and-up.sh`, or another
   general deploy helper for this staging step: those paths switch `current`
   and/or start services before re-encryption verification.

   ```bash
   cd /opt/npcink-ai-cloud/releases/STAGED_RELEASE
   umask 077
   ENV_SOURCE=/opt/npcink-ai-cloud/.env.deploy
   if [ ! -f "${ENV_SOURCE}" ]; then
     ENV_SOURCE=/opt/npcink-ai-cloud/current/.env.deploy
   fi
   test -f "${ENV_SOURCE}"
   install -m 600 "${ENV_SOURCE}" ./.env.deploy
   test "$(stat -c '%a' ./.env.deploy)" = "600"
   ```

3. Use the production `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`. Keep `postgres` and `redis`
   running, but stop and fence all four writers: `api`, `worker`,
   `callback-worker`, and `ops-worker`. Keep public traffic in
   maintenance/fail-closed mode until the cutover is verified:

   ```bash
   cd /opt/npcink-ai-cloud/releases/STAGED_RELEASE
   export COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME="${NPCINK_CLOUD_COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME:-npcink-ai-cloud}"
   docker compose --env-file .env.deploy -f docker-compose.runtime.yml up -d postgres redis
   docker compose --env-file .env.deploy -f docker-compose.runtime.yml \
     stop api worker callback-worker ops-worker
   ```

4. Create a custom-format PostgreSQL backup with restrictive permissions,
   record its SHA-256 checksum, restore it into a separate verification
   database, and prove that the restored inventory is readable with the old
   code and old key. A database dump without its matching key is not a usable
   encrypted-data recovery point.
5. Create an untracked maintenance env file outside the release directory and
   set it to mode `0600`. It must contain the target envelope and one explicit
   old root, while normal production settings continue to come from the staged
   `.env.deploy`:

   ```text
   NPCINK_CLOUD_RUNTIME_DATA_ENCRYPTION_SECRET=<target-secret>
   NPCINK_CLOUD_RUNTIME_DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY_ID=<target-key-id>
   NPCINK_CLOUD_RUNTIME_DATA_OLD_ROOT_SECRET=<old-root-secret>
   ```

   ```bash
   export MAINTENANCE_ENV=/run/npcink-ai-cloud/runtime-data-reencrypt.env
   test "$(stat -c '%a' "${MAINTENANCE_ENV}")" = "600"
   ```

6. From the staged release directory, run all phases through a one-off `api`
   container from the new image. `--no-deps` prevents these commands from
   starting any stopped writer or replacing the already-running database/cache:

   ```bash
   docker compose --env-file .env.deploy -f docker-compose.runtime.yml \
     run --rm --no-deps --env-from-file "${MAINTENANCE_ENV}" api \
     python -m app.dev.reencrypt_runtime_data inventory
   docker compose --env-file .env.deploy -f docker-compose.runtime.yml \
     run --rm --no-deps --env-from-file "${MAINTENANCE_ENV}" api \
     python -m app.dev.reencrypt_runtime_data dry-run \
       --old-root-env NPCINK_CLOUD_RUNTIME_DATA_OLD_ROOT_SECRET
   docker compose --env-file .env.deploy -f docker-compose.runtime.yml \
     run --rm --no-deps --env-from-file "${MAINTENANCE_ENV}" api \
     python -m app.dev.reencrypt_runtime_data apply \
       --confirm-maintenance-window \
       --old-root-env NPCINK_CLOUD_RUNTIME_DATA_OLD_ROOT_SECRET
   docker compose --env-file .env.deploy -f docker-compose.runtime.yml \
     run --rm --no-deps --env-from-file "${MAINTENANCE_ENV}" api \
     python -m app.dev.reencrypt_runtime_data verify
   ```

   The first raw-ciphertext cutover intentionally omits `--old-key-id`.

   For a future `rde.v1` to `rde.v1` rotation, inventory must declare the old
   envelope key ID even though it does not need the old root. Then `dry-run` and
   `apply` must pair that same key ID positionally with its old root:

   ```bash
   export OLD_RUNTIME_DATA_KEY_ID=rde-previous-key-id
   docker compose --env-file .env.deploy -f docker-compose.runtime.yml \
     run --rm --no-deps --env-from-file "${MAINTENANCE_ENV}" api \
     python -m app.dev.reencrypt_runtime_data inventory --old-key-id "${OLD_RUNTIME_DATA_KEY_ID}"
   docker compose --env-file .env.deploy -f docker-compose.runtime.yml \
     run --rm --no-deps --env-from-file "${MAINTENANCE_ENV}" api \
     python -m app.dev.reencrypt_runtime_data dry-run \
       --old-root-env NPCINK_CLOUD_RUNTIME_DATA_OLD_ROOT_SECRET \
       --old-key-id "${OLD_RUNTIME_DATA_KEY_ID}"
   docker compose --env-file .env.deploy -f docker-compose.runtime.yml \
     run --rm --no-deps --env-from-file "${MAINTENANCE_ENV}" api \
     python -m app.dev.reencrypt_runtime_data apply \
       --confirm-maintenance-window \
       --old-root-env NPCINK_CLOUD_RUNTIME_DATA_OLD_ROOT_SECRET \
       --old-key-id "${OLD_RUNTIME_DATA_KEY_ID}"
   ```

   Add further `--old-root-env`/`--old-key-id` pairs only when preflight evidence
   proves multiple historical envelopes. Stop immediately on an unreadable row,
   count mismatch, partial-apply error, or verification failure. Do not start
   any writer after a failed phase.
7. After new-key-only verification succeeds, update both the staged/current and
   shared `.env.deploy` copies with the same target secret/key ID and keep them
   mode `0600`. Promote the verified staged release; do not rerun the ordinary
   deploy sequence for the key change.
8. Start `api` from that same release image and verify `/health/ready`; then
   start `worker`, `callback-worker`, and `ops-worker`; finally restore
   `frontend`, `proxy`, and external-Edge traffic. Verify
   `/health/operational-ready`, fresh heartbeats and cadence, signed runtime
   execution/result retrieval, terminal callback delivery, Addon connection
   consumption, and idempotent Portal replay.
9. After the rollback-evidence window, securely delete the maintenance env and
   temporary old-key copies. Normal runtime has no legacy or dual-read path;
   retain the migration-only re-encryption tool for future controlled rekeys.

If rollback is required, fence the same four writers and restore the matching
old database backup (the pre-cutover snapshot), old application revision, and
old key together.
After new-key writes have begun, rolling back only code or only the environment
is invalid; use a verified reverse re-encryption or accept the explicitly
approved loss of post-cutover writes when restoring the full old recovery point.

## Worker Operations

### Restart workers

Run on the release host:

```bash
cd /opt/npcink-ai-cloud
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME="${NPCINK_CLOUD_COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME:-npcink-ai-cloud}" \
  docker compose -f docker-compose.runtime.yml restart worker callback-worker ops-worker
```

Then verify:

- `GET /health/operational-ready` returns `200`
- `GET /internal/service/observability/summary` shows fresh worker heartbeats
- `GET /internal/service/ops/cadence` shows non-fresh tasks recovering toward fresh

## Resource Tuning Baseline

Tune resources through environment variables and service restarts, not by
editing production application code on the server. Server-side changes remain
limited to `.env.deploy` secrets/config and must be backported if they become
durable release requirements.

Primary knobs:

- `NPCINK_CLOUD_API_WORKERS`: gunicorn API worker count. Keep it within the
  release host CPU and memory budget.
- `NPCINK_CLOUD_RUNTIME_WORKER_POLL_SECONDS`: runtime queue polling cadence.
- `NPCINK_CLOUD_RUNTIME_CALLBACK_WORKER_POLL_SECONDS`: callback dispatch polling
  cadence.
- `NPCINK_CLOUD_WORKER_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_SECONDS`: heartbeat freshness window
  for worker health checks.
- `NPCINK_CLOUD_OPS_CADENCE_POLL_SECONDS`: ops cadence loop frequency.
- `NPCINK_CLOUD_RETENTION_CLEANUP_INTERVAL_SECONDS`: retention cleanup cadence.
- `NPCINK_CLOUD_USAGE_ROLLUP_INTERVAL_SECONDS`: usage rollup cadence.
- `NPCINK_CLOUD_ROUTER_DIAGNOSTICS_INTERVAL_SECONDS`: router diagnostics cadence.
- `NPCINK_CLOUD_LATENCY_PROBE_INTERVAL_SECONDS`: latency probe cadence.
- `NPCINK_CLOUD_ALERT_PROVIDER_DEGRADATION_INTERVAL_SECONDS`: provider
  degradation alert cadence.
- `NPCINK_CLOUD_PROVIDER_HEALTH_SCAN_INTERVAL_SECONDS`: provider health scan
  cadence.
- `NPCINK_CLOUD_ARTIFACT_RECONCILIATION_INTERVAL_SECONDS`: read-only artifact
  inventory reconciliation cadence.
- `NPCINK_CLOUD_ARTIFACT_RECONCILIATION_SAFETY_WINDOW_SECONDS`: minimum object
  age before an unreferenced object is reported as eligible; C2a never deletes it.
- `NPCINK_CLOUD_ARTIFACT_RECONCILIATION_PAGE_SIZE`: bounded store and database
  inventory page size, from 1 through 500.
- `NPCINK_CLOUD_ARTIFACT_ORPHAN_CLEANUP_ENABLED`: destructive orphan cleanup;
  it defaults to `false` and must remain false until P3-B4C3 is accepted.
- `NPCINK_CLOUD_ARTIFACT_ORPHAN_CLEANUP_BATCH_SIZE`: per-cadence candidate cap,
  from 1 through 100; each candidate receives its own non-blocking EX fence.

The artifact volume root must remain stable and writable only by the service
owner or trusted operators. Do not replace its mount, shard directories, or
private publication-fence file while API/runtime/ops workers are running.
C2a `orphan_eligible` remains age evidence and never authorizes manual
deletion. Keep C2b automatic cleanup off until PostgreSQL 16 multi-connection
and real named-volume proof is complete. Before any later enablement, verify
service-account ownership and safe modes for root/shards/files, private `0600`
single-link generation marker and lock files, stable mount/root identity, and
that every namespace writer obeys the advisory fence. See
[`docs/media-derivative-operations-runbook-v1.md`](../docs/media-derivative-operations-runbook-v1.md#orphan-cleanup-enablement-gate)
for the full enablement and rollback checklist.

After any resource or cadence change:

1. Restart only the affected services when possible: `api`, `worker`,
   `callback-worker`, or `ops-worker`.
2. Verify `GET /health/operational-ready`.
3. Verify `GET /internal/service/observability/summary` shows fresh heartbeats.
4. Verify `GET /internal/service/ops/cadence` has no unexpected stale tasks.
5. Run one signed runtime smoke when worker or provider cadence changed.
6. Record the changed variables and rollback values in operator notes.

### Callback backlog recovery

1. Check `GET /internal/service/observability/summary`.
2. Inspect `runtime.summary.callback` and `runtime.backlog`.
3. If `callback.dispatching_stale` or overdue callbacks persist, restart `callback-worker`.
4. Recheck `/internal/service/runtime/diagnostics/runs?issue_kind=callback_overdue`.
5. Confirm backlog declines before broader intervention.

### Manual retention cleanup

Use only when cadence is stale or blocked:

```bash
curl -X POST "$NPCINK_CLOUD_BASE_URL/internal/service/runtime/retention/cleanup" \
  -H "X-Npcink-Internal-Token: $NPCINK_CLOUD_INTERNAL_AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: manual-retention-cleanup-$(date +%s)"
```

Then verify:

- `GET /internal/service/ops/cadence`
- `GET /internal/service/audit-events?event_kind=runtime.retention_cleanup&limit=5`

## Database Rollback

1. Confirm the target backup artifact exists before release.
2. Stop write traffic if rollback is required.
3. Restore the known-good database snapshot using the host-specific restore procedure.
4. Restart `api`, `worker`, `callback-worker`, and `ops-worker`.
5. Verify `/health/ready` and `/internal/service/observability/summary`.

For a runtime-data encryption cutover, this general database-only procedure is
insufficient. Restore the matched old backup, old application revision, and old
key together as specified in **Runtime-data encryption key cutover**.

## Provider Failover

1. Inspect `providers.degraded_provider_ids` in `GET /internal/service/observability/summary`.
2. Cross-check `alert.provider_degradation_cadence` freshness in `GET /internal/service/ops/cadence`.
3. Update provider routing/connection state from the local plugin control plane, not from Cloud.
4. Confirm the selected provider for the release host has a real credential configured before retrying runtime smoke.
5. Re-run one real runtime request and confirm provider health recovers in the next cadence window.

If real runtime smoke returns `runtime.provider_not_configured`, treat it as a release-blocking environment failure, not as a soft smoke warning.

## Cadence Stale Recovery

1. Check `GET /health/operational-ready`.
2. Inspect `GET /internal/service/ops/cadence`.
3. If one or more tasks are stale, restart `ops-worker`.
4. If staleness persists, inspect `service_audit_events` for the failing cadence task.
5. If runtime smoke fails after cadence recovery, inspect provider health,
   runtime diagnostics, site/key lifecycle, and entitlement evidence before
   changing WordPress-side controls.
6. After recovery, verify `non_fresh_total == 0`.

## Trace Sink Check

1. Read `data.tracing.otlp_endpoint`, `data.tracing.otlp_configured`,
   `data.tracing.trace_query_url`, and `data.tracing.trace_query_configured`
   from `GET /internal/service/observability/summary`.
2. Open the configured query URL or trace UI.
3. Trigger a fresh internal request such as `GET /health/operational-ready`.
4. Confirm a new trace for `npcink-ai-cloud` appears in the sink.
5. If either URL is absent, export fails, or no fresh trace is queryable, the
   formal release is not closed. Ordinary non-release runtime may leave both
   values empty.

## Release Gate

Before a formal release, operators must start from `deploy/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`.

The release gate is divided into:

- repo ready
- env required
- operator required
- smoke required

`repo ready` can be closed by repository evidence. `env required`, `operator required`, and `smoke required` must be closed on the actual release host. If any item in those categories is incomplete, the release is blocked.

`deploy/release-smoke.sh` is the formal smoke gate. Do not replace it with a second release entry point or a partial manual checklist.

Operators must be able to answer all of these from current data:

- Is the API ready?
- Are `worker`, `callback-worker`, and `ops-worker` alive?
- Is execution backlog separated from callback backlog?
- Are managed cadence tasks fresh?
- Is provider health fresh, and which provider is degraded?
- Is OTLP tracing wired to the configured external endpoint and is a fresh
  trace queryable?
- Has one real signed runtime request succeeded against the production provider configuration?
- Do signed run lookup, result retrieval, stats, and usage evidence remain readable?
